# before we can use the code we must a assign m to a square matrix which can be inverted

# m <- matrix(runif(16), 4) 

# store matrix in makeCacheMatrix which returnes a list

# cache <- makeCacheMatrix(m)

# cach$get() # get the matrix

# Calculate the inverse of the matrix 

# cacheSolve(cach)

# repeat the last command to retrive the inverse from cach
